# TurtlePay® Project Roadmap

This is a general roadmap for the TurtlePay® project. It is subject to change and re-ordering as the community requires and as the TurtleCoin®  and TurtlePay® projects evolve. As with the TurtleCoin® project, we believe that slow and steady is the best way to ensure success and as such are dividing the different development goals into individual phases to help guarantee our success.

## Phase 1

Phase 1 will consist of the completion of the following items:

* Public Website Launch
    * Website will contain general information about the project, this roadmap, and other pertinent project information
    * Account services will **not** be ready at this point
* All necessary TurtleCoin® nodes will be deployed
* The [Blockchain Database Storage System (BDSS)](https://github.com/TurtlePay/architecture/blob/master/Architecture.md#blockchain-database-storage-system-bdss) will be implemented
* The [Blockchain Data Collection Agent (BDCA)](https://github.com/TurtlePay/architecture/blob/master/Architecture.md#blockchain-data-collection-agent-bdca) will be implemented
* The design of the Application Programming Interface (API) will be prepared

## Phase 2

Phase 2 will consist of the completion of the following items:

* v1 of the Application Programming Interface (API)
    * Access to blockchain information as provided by the BDSS
    * Ability to generate a Payment Request will be available
    * Ability to specify a POST BACK url once the system determines that the payment as been completed on chain.
* Tracking of transactions by Payment ID
* Standard libraries in a few languages will be completed to interact with the API at this point

## Phase 3

* Implementation of [TurtleCoin® Wallet Services (TCWS)](https://github.com/TurtlePay/architecture/blob/master/Architecture.md#turtlecoin-wallet-services-tcws) into the platform
    * Includes the development of One Time Use (OTU) wallets
* v2 of the Application Programming Interface (API)
    * Payment Requests will be altered to permit the use of the TCWS wallet(s) to serve as intermediary wallet(s).
    * Additional methods will be provided to allow developers to poll the status of the transaction(s) via the API
* Updated standard libraries for interacting with the API
* TurtlePay® account services including:
    * Dashboard
    * Account Maintenance
    * Application Registration
    * Account Creation

## Phase 4
